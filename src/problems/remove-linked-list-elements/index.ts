  description: `# Remove Linked List Elements

**Difficulty:** Easy  
**Topic:** Linked List

---

## Description

You are given the head of a linked list and an integer \`val\`, remove all the nodes of the linked list that has \`Node.val == val\`, and return the new head.

---

## Examples

### Example 1:

\`\`\`
Input: head = [2,1,4,1,2,3], val = 2

Output: [1,4,1,3]

Explanation: Remove all nodes with value 2.
\`\`\`

### Example 2:

\`\`\`
Input: head = [1,1], val = 1

Output: []

Explanation: All nodes have value 1, remove them all.
\`\`\`

---

## Constraints

- \`0 <= Length of the list <= 10,000\`
- \`1 <= Node.val <= 50\`
- \`0 <= val <= 50\``,
